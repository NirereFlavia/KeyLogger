### Hi there! I am NirereFlavia👋

  <b>Today we are going to study about Keylogger</b>  
</h1>

### 👊Main knowldge about KeyLogger
<p1>😉To peaple who doesn't know a <t color:Red>Keylogger</t>, A keylogger program is a program or a tool that is designed to secretly record the data that we type on a keyboard ⌨. Keylogger program is installed secretly on our system, It targets the system when the user is working on it and records the keystrokes in a text file, the keylogger sends the text files to the cyber criminal🦹, the recorded data can be used by the hacker. </p1>

### 👉Indicators of a keylogger in your system
  
<h>-Increased CPU usage, especially when you're not actively using the computer, may indicate the presence of a keylogger.<br>
-If your system behaves unusually, such as slow performance, freezing, or crashing, it may be a sign of malicious activity.<br>
-Some keyloggers may install additional toolbars or icons on your desktop without your knowledge.<br>
-Keyloggers may be associated with adware or malicious software that generates unwanted pop-ups or ads.<br>
-If you are using a laptop, an unexpected battery drain may be a sign of increased activity caused by a keylogger.<br>

<h>
<b>🎯The aime of these project is to create a KeyLogger but only for learning purpose⚠️</b>
  <h>
<p> 🛠️One of the important python libraries we are going to be using is pynput which include keyboard module which can be used to capture key events from user. After building our program, we will be able to record every data typed on our keyboard.<br>
✅Make sure that you allow threats (Found in settings in Virus and Threats protection).</p>
